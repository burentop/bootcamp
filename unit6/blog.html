	<p class="first">For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! It's a T. It goes "tuh". Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?  Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.</p>
	<p>Who are you, my warranty?! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. And until then, I can never die? I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

	A true inspiration for the children. Why would I want to know that? Anyone who laughs is a communist! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

	Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p>
	<p>Tell them I hate them. Noooooo! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p>

	<h2>This Is Another Article</h2>
	<p class="first">That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
	<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! It doesn't look so shiny to me. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

	Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

	A true inspiration for the children. Why would a robot need to drink? Kids have names? It's toe-tappingly tragic! You're going to do his laundry? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p>
	<p>Moving along… Shinier than yours, meatbag. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
